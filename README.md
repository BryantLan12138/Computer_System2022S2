Repo for Computer System COMP SCI 7081

As computer scientists, engineers, and IT professionals, we work with, develop for, and troubleshoot computer systems on a daily basis, but how much do we know about the way these systems actually work?

This course introduces the core parts that make up computer systems from the level of basic logic gates, through to CPU architecture, machine language, compilers, and applications. In doing do, we hope that you'll gain an understanding of the fundamental workings of computers that will help inform the way you work with these systems in your further studies and careers.

We are continually reviewing and developing this course to ensure the skills and knowledge you take away will prove useful, and we look forward to meeting you and working with you over the coming weeks.
